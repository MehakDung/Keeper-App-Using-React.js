# Keeper-App-Clone-of-Google-Keep-
It is an imitation of the popular Google Keep Application which is a note-taking service. I have created this using React.js.

It uses React Hooks, state, props, and array mapping to allow for the creation and deletion of notes.
The Keeper App also uses Materialâ€‘UI components and icons.
